# ontop-blocker

This program makes a green square that stays on top of other windows.
If you hover over it it goes semi transparent so you can see what's underneath.

To quit press escape while the window is active (i.e. click on it then press escape).

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/brabes/ontop-blocker/releases/latest) to download.
